Ben Eater teaches computing and electronics. Perhaps the most extra ordinary things he has done is build an 8-bit computer on breadboards.

Perhaps this isn't so extra ordinary as the early pioneers in micro computing such as Steve Wozniac did exactly that. However, it still looks amazing.

This is a fully functional 8-bit computer built with wires and breadboard.
