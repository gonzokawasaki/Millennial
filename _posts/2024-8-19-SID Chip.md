The C64 was the third computer I ever owned after the ZX81 and the ZX Spectrum. One of the features that set the machine apart from its contemporaries was the SID chip. The Sound Interface Device, or SID chip had three channel programmable sound. You could set the attack/decay envelope to produce a wide range of sound qualities. 

The C64 enjoyed a host of titles that featured some quite amazing music from the likes of Rob Hubbard and Martin Galway. One of my personal favourites was the Ocean Loader written by Martin Galway. Now a whole scene seems to have emerged with sound visualization of these 8-bit classics. Check it out.
