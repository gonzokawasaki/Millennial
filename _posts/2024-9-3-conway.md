I have recently begun a project with STEM students in grade 8, 9 and 10 looking at Conway's Game of Life. Now I am being a little bit ambitious in trying to link the idea of emergent complexity to what happens in an AI system. I hope this works by way of explaining to students what is currently happening with all the AI systems they are seeing pop up.
