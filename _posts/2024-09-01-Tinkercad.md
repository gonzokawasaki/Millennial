One of the best online teaching resources I have used during the lockdowns has been Tinkercad. Tinkercad allows students to explore electronics and 3D modelling.

I have used it with all my secondary school classes to build and program virtual Arduino's. Not only does it allow students to build electronics virtually online, but it also supports downloading the code to a real Arduino.

I can also create class groups and inspect student work. It really is one of the best resources for online STEM teaching.
