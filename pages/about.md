Hello,

I am a STEM teacher of some 20 years. I began teaching animation and games design. This was primarily using 3D modelling software such as Blender and Maya, and also game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.

Nowadays I mostly teach stuff like Arduino and Microbit coding, 3D modelling and printing and coding. These pages have some examples of my work and interests.
